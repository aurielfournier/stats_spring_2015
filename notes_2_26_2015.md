  Moran's I test under randomisation

data:  columbus$INC  
weights: colqueen  

Moran I statistic standard deviate = 4.6967, p-value = 2.643e-06
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
sample estimates:
Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance 
       0.41683794       -0.02083333        0.00868364 

expected values are based on the number of elements, not the values
very small p values
4.69 SD larger then what you would expect
positive correlation (tend to be like their neighbors, your value is similar to your neighbors)

```
moran.plot(columbus$INC, colqueen)
```

mean is about 14 (dotted line on x axis)
the outliers are highlited (1011, 1015, 1049, 1017 and 1016)
those places are the ones where you want to look first
each represents a census block
1011 is well below the mean, but the units around it are much higher then the mean. 
1015 - neighbors are much higher then average
1049, 1016 and 1017 are much higher then average, neighbors are closer to the average
fit of the regression line is now how outliers are identified (it is how they relate to their neighbors)
the marked ones are having the most impact on the regression line
plot tells you the 'odd ones' and the overall effect 
the slope of the line is the global Moran's I
```
moran.plot(columbus$CRIME,colqueen)
```
fewer odd ones
slope is the same as the above graph (or close)
```
moran.test(columbus$CRIME,colqueen)
```
  Moran's I test under randomisation

data:  columbus$CRIME  
weights: colqueen  

Moran I statistic standard deviate = 5.3427, p-value = 4.578e-08
alternative hypothesis: greater
sample estimates:
Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance 
      0.485770914      -0.020833333       0.008991121 

very positive correlationed (very like their neighbors)
expectation is what we would expect to see from a random distribution of n numbers
