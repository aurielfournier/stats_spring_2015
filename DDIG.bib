abstract = {1.Distance sampling is a widely used technique for estimating the size or density of biological populations. Many distance sampling designs and most analyses use the software Distance.2.We briefly review distance sampling and its assumptions, outline the history, structure and capabilities of Distance, and provide hints on its use.3.Good survey design is a crucial prerequisite for obtaining reliable results. Distance has a survey design engine, with a built-in geographic information system, that allows properties of different proposed designs to be examined via simulation, and survey plans to be generated.4.A first step in analysis of distance sampling data is modelling the probability of detection. Distance contains three increasingly sophisticated analysis engines for this: conventional distance sampling, which models detection probability as a function of distance from the transect and assumes all objects at zero distance are detected; multiple-covariate distance sampling, which allows covariates in addition to distance; and mark-recapture distance sampling, which relaxes the assumption of certain detection at zero distance.5.All three engines allow estimation of density or abundance, stratified if required, with associated measures of precision calculated either analytically or via the bootstrap.6.Advanced analysis topics covered include the use of multipliers to allow analysis of indirect surveys (such as dung or nest surveys), the density surface modelling analysis engine for spatial and habitat modelling, and information about accessing the analysis engines directly from other software.7.Synthesis and applications. Distance sampling is a key method for producing abundance and density estimates in challenging field conditions. The theory underlying the methods continues to expand to cope with realistic estimation situations. In step with theoretical developments, state-of-the-art software that implements these methods is described that makes the methods accessible to practising ecologists.},

abstract = {Migration monitoring stations (MMSs) were established to provide information on population trends of North American passerines. However, apart from inferring general origins of birds, there has been no way to delineate geographical catchment areas sampled by MMSs. The ability to resolve MMS catchment areas would greatly enhance our ability to link and constrain population declines to specific geographical areas and thereby focus conservation efforts. Here, we utilize stable-hydrogen (delta D) and carbon (delta 13C) isotope values of rectrices of fall hatch-year (HY) and spring adult after-second year (ASY) Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) moving through two MMSs in Canada to determine natal and molting catchment areas for those stations. Stable-carbon isotope signatures provided no information on geographical origins of birds. Conversely, delta D signatures provided good latitudinal geographical control, and this was also supported by analysis of feathers from two other species, Gray-cheeked Thrush (Catharus minimus) and Harris' Sparrow (Zonotrichia querula), also known to breed and molt in northern regions. The delta D values of fall HY birds moving through Delta Marsh MMSs in Manitoba were more negative than those moving through Long Point MMSs in southern Ontario, clearly indicating more northwesterly origins. However, based on delta D values alone, both MMSs sampled birds from broad catchment regions of the Canadian Boreal forest. The interpolated catchment area of the Delta MMS encompassed northwest Manitoba to northwestern Alberta. The interpolated catchment area of the Long Point MMS extended from north central Ontario and Quebec and into western Canada. The delta D values of birds moving northward in spring suggested that most ASY Swainson's Thrush molted at more southerly locations than their breeding sites. We show the stable-hydrogen isotope approach may be employed to significantly improve conventional observational techniques for avian population monitoring, and that MMSs provide a reliable means of associating population productivity with regional conservation issues.},
